Okay, little buddy, imagine you have a big piece of graph paper and some toy rocks, and you want to draw a line from your red toy car to your green toy castle without bumping into the rocks. Here’s how the “computer game” you showed works:


A Big Drawing Board

There’s a big rectangle (the canvas) where everything happens, just like your playmat.

Grid Squares

The playmat is covered in lots of little squares (the grid). You can make the squares bigger or smaller with the number box.

Red Car and Green Castle

A red circle is your car (start), and a green circle is your castle (goal). You can drag them around with your finger (or mouse) to new places.

Random Rocks

Black circles are rocks. When you press “Randomize Obstacles,” the computer scatters eight rocks in new spots so your car can’t go through them.

Finding a Path

When you press “Run,” the computer looks at the grid and figures out a way from the red car to the green castle that doesn’t crash into any rocks.

Making the Path Pretty

First, it draws a simple straight-step path—like hopping from square to square.

Then it uses different “magic crayons” (algorithms) to round corners, smooth out the line, or even run a second check to make it extra neat.

Choosing Your Magic Crayon

There’s a dropdown menu where you pick how fancy you want the path to look:

“A* + Earcut” is the basic crayon.

“+ Bézier” adds round curves.

“+ Chaikin” makes it even softer, like drawing with chalk.

And “Full Pipeline” does all the magic steps in order.

Seeing What’s Happening

The little gray box (debug) tells you how many squares it looked at, how many bumps it smoothed, and other fun numbers so you know it’s working.

So every time you press “Run,” it’s like asking the computer: “Hey, what’s the best way to drive my red car across these squares without hitting the rocks?” And it draws you that neat, colorful path!

## Running the Demo on Windows

A batch file `install_and_start.bat` is included to help install dependencies and run `star.py`. Double-click the file or run it from the command prompt. It creates a virtual environment on your Desktop, installs the required packages, and launches the demo with `abbb1.png`.
